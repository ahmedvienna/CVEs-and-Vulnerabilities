# POC
1. Dear Sirs and Madams,
1. I would like to report a business logic error vulnerability that I discovered during my recent penetration test on Froxlor.
1. Specifically, I identified an issue where it was possible to submit the registration form with the essential fields, such as the username and password, left intentionally blank. This inadvertent omission allowed for a bypass of the mandatory field requirements established by the system.
1. The surname, family name AND company name all of them can be left blank.
1. I believe addressing this vulnerability is crucial to ensure the security and integrity of the Froxlor platform.
1. This action served as a means to bypass the mandatory field requirements.
1. Lets see (please have a look at the Video -> attachment).
1. as you can see i was able to let the username and second name blank.
